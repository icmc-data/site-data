We will explore techniques such as Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Transformers, and multi-mesh approaches used to capture intricate ocean dynamics, handle sparse and irregular data from various sources (including time series, satellite images, and physical models), and effectively propagate information over large spatial scales. Additionally, the integration of physics-informed machine learning principles within graph-based frameworks will be discussed to ensure physical consistency, enhance generalization capabilities, and enable resolution-invariant predictions. The presentation contextualizes these methods within the Digital Transformation Project of the Offshore Technology Innovation Center (OTIC) and the Numerical Test Tank (TPN-USP), demonstrating how these advanced graph-based models are being developed and applied to meet critical offshore industry demands, such as robust meteo-ocean forecasts, environmental monitoring, estimation of hidden variables, and the optimization of operations for safety and efficiency.",

Modeling data as graphs allows for incorporating multiple feature modalities, creating richer and more informative representations, as well as efficiently capturing relationships between data. In this mini-course, we will explore techniques for modeling unstructured data using graphs, delve into representation learning through graph neural networks, and discuss the advantages of this approach and its applications in machine learning. Fundamental concepts of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), along with popular variants such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), will be presented. The course also includes practical demonstrations for transductive node classification based on a real-world problem, enabling participants to experiment with and implement the discussed concepts.",
