Additionally, the integration of physics-informed machine learning principles within graph-based frameworks will be discussed to ensure physical consistency, enhance generalization capabilities, and enable resolution-invariant predictions. The presentation contextualizes these methods within the Digital Transformation Project of the Offshore Technology Innovation Center (OTIC) and the Numerical Test Tank (TPN-USP), demonstrating how these advanced graph-based models are being developed and applied to meet critical offshore industry demands, such as robust meteo-ocean forecasts, environmental monitoring, estimation of hidden variables, and the optimization of operations for safety and efficiency.",
